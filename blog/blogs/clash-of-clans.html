<h2>Clash of Clans</h2>

<!--
	Gem to money ratio is good.
		You can speed up a lot of stuff for $5.
		Lowest gem amount is $5.
		Generous gem gifts.
		Not in your face about buying gems.
	Retention is good due to the constant need to return to the game.
	They forcefully ask you to rate the game after good events happen.
	Battles are forgiving.
		You don't feel like you lost everything when you lose a battle.
			Not all of your money is available loot.
		You get a shield after having some percentage destroyed.
	Attacks are rewarding
		You get extra trophies on top of the ones they lose
		If you do good you can get bonus gold and elixir
	There are tons of things to upgrade and do.
		Walls
		Rocks and Trees
		Collectors
		Storages
		Town Hall
		Defenses
		Traps
		Build troops
		Attack
		Restructure Town
			The way you attack and the structure of the town hall make this very dynamic
		Lots of statistics and Data
		Achievements
		Rewatch battles
	There is actually a lot to do between waiting for things to build.
	The game is EPIC
		Numbers scale by degrees of magnitude as you level up. One minute you are happy the get 1000 gold then you aren't satisfied by 10,000.
	



	Boom Beach vs. Clash of Clans
	=============================

	
	Boom beach
	====

	Has a world map
	can scout out base before attacking
	All battles happen from one direction
	Battle ends when you destroy the headquarters.
		Destroying the headquarters gives you all of the resources
	Troops aren't lost unless they die.
	There is less precision in troop placement since they can just get dropped off on the shoreline
		But there are more ways to interact through signal flares and missles during combat.
	You have to upgrade your radar to be able to do ANYTHING... AHHHHHH!!!!!
	All the characters look the same
		Clone workers building something
		Same two tribe people jump out of every hole
	You attack people based on the pretense that they are part of the black whatever...
	You find treasure as you explore the map.
		Treasure spawns over time as well.
	The black guard attacks back against your captured islands so there is constant strife.
	Game is based on your gold acquisition through island ownership and residences.
	LONELY!!!!
		"Makes a big world feel really small"
		Don't feel like i've been attacked (only day 2 though).
		Never attacking anyone... maybe 3 so far.

	As you can see the only time that it is an issue is when you are passing
	classes that you created into the generic spot of a different class that
	you created.  If you are making a class that takes in generic object types
	like a custom stack, queue, graph, factory, etc., then you will need to
	make sure that you are only passing it standard C# or UnityEngine objects.
	If you need to make a factory for custom objects then you need to do it the
	old fasion way by casting the appropriate type of object.
<p>

<code class="code code-good">public class Stack {
	public Object pop() { /* ... */ }
}
(SomeObject) stack.pop()
