<h2>IOS, Unity, and C# Generics</h2>

<p>
	If you plan on deploying your Unity games to IOS then you should not
	use Generics. When unity converts your C# code to Objective C, IOS byte
	code or whatever else it is doing, the generics don't always work the
	way that they do in the editor or
	in Java (Android).  Even worse, the errors seem to get compiled, but
	then just fail once it's been pushed to the device.  For me the device
	just seemed to freeze on the splash screen.  The generics seem to work
	with built in Unity objects, but not with custom objects that you make 
	yourself.  For instance:
</p>

<code class="code code-good">List&lt;Vector2&gt; l = new List&lt;Vector2&gt; ();
</code>

<code class="code code-good">List&lt;CustomObject&gt; l = new List&lt;CustomObject&gt; ();
</code>

<code class="code code-good">public class GenericObject &lt;T&gt; {
	// ...
}
GenericObject&lt;Vector2&gt; o = new GenericObject&lt;Vector2&gt; ();
</code>

<code class="code code-bad">public class GenericObject &lt;T&gt; {
	// ...
}
GenericObject&lt;CustomObject&gt; o = new GenericObject&lt;CustomObject&gt; ();
</code>

<p>
	As you can see the only time that it is an issue is when you are passing
	classes that you created into the generic spot of a different class that
	you created.  If you are making a class that takes in generic object types
	like a custom stack, queue, graph, factory, etc., then you will need to
	make sure that you are only passing it standard C# or UnityEngine objects.
	If you need to make a factory for custom objects then you need to do it the
	old fasion way by casting the appropriate type of object.
<p>

<code class="code code-good">public class Stack {
	public Object pop() { /* ... */ }
}
(SomeObject) stack.pop()
</code>
